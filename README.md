# Tic-tac-toe / Tris MEAN application

Created with MongoDB + ExpressJS + AngularJS + NodeJS

This is only an example that I wrote very quickly :)


# Requirements

1. MongoDB
2. NodeJS 7.x.x and npm 4.x.x
3. A web browser

# Configuration

If needed modify `.env` file, specifying your MongoDB URL and so on.


# How to run

1. `cd server`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Visit http://localhost:3000 to see this application


If you want to generate the documentation of REST apis run `npm run docs`

To run this application in a production environment (really really not recommended, because it is only an example) run `npm run prod:start` and to stop it `npm run prod:stop`
